Travel Deals Webpage


Overview
This project is a responsive web application designed for travelers to find the best deals on tours and hotels. Utilizing Node.js, I have generated dummy data to simulate a real-world application that allows users to filter and select travel packages according to their preferences.

Features
Dynamic Search Filter: Users can search for tours and hotels by destination, dates, and number of people.
Price Range Slider: A slider that helps to adjust the search according to the budget.
Meal Plan Options: Allows filtering based on the type of meal plan, like All Inclusive, Half Board, or Room Only.
Star Rating Filter: Users can filter the results by the star ratings of hotels or tours.
Sort Functionality: Search results can be sorted by price (low to high or high to low) or alphabetically.
Responsive Design: The webpage is fully responsive and accessible on a wide range of devices.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js
Dummy Data Generation: Used Node.js to create a script that generates dummy data for the application.
